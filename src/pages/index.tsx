        <p className="mb-4">{`In late 2019, inspired as a pedicab driver, I aimed to start my own business and realized a website was crucial. Diving into self-education through Udemy, my journey took a turn when the pandemic hit, leading me to discover a passion for coding. After a year and a half of immersing myself in online resources like blogs, YouTube, Coursera, and FreeCodeCamp, I joined TouchBistro. Today, I contribute to our Remote Menu Management solution, focusing on expanding to Multi-Venue customers.`}</p>
